          <p>Internship at Deed</p>

          <p>A fruitful experience with a company developing an app that helps users organize and find volunteer events in their city. As a Front End Developer Intern, I have learned alot with programming alongside an experienced front end developer and UX designer.
            While starting off learning the ropes of React, React Native, and TypeScript, I eventually learnt to accomplish my tasks with less hand holding and with more experimental curiousity.
